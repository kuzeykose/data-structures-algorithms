# Data Structure & Algorithms

Implementation of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages: the main target is assimilating the general perspective of each data structure and algorithm.

Data structures start with elementary topics such as linked lists, stacks, and queues, then continue with complex structures. The list below shows each topic. [Data Structures](#data-structures)

Algorithms start with divide and conquer and continue with sorting, matching, graphs, etc. The list below shows each topic. [Algorithms](#Algorithms)
